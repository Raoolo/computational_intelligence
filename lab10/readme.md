## Reinforcement learning for Tic-Tac-Toe game
---
### Objective
We want to create an agent that can learn the optimal strategy to beat the adversary through iterations of the game.
The games will be based on a 3x3 grid, that can easily be modified, and the agent is the player that has to learn the best strategy by observing the state of the game (the board). To learn we will reward good actions and penalyze wrong ones.
